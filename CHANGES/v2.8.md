## Version 2.8 (under development)

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.8

- Changes leading to differences with previous versions
  - in \ref METAD if possible the root walker in WALKERS_MPI will set the folder from which reading the GRID/HILLS file upon restart
  - in \ref METAD work is not calculated by default anymore, if needed it can be obtained using CALC_WORK
  - in \ref METAD an error will be thrown if when restarting from FILE the file is not found

- New actions:
  - \ref GHBFIX to compute generalized hydrogen-bond fixes

- New contributed module:
  - A new SASA module by Andrea Arsiccio
     - \ref SASA_HASEL
     - \ref SASA_LCPO

- Other improvements
  - in \ref METAD a new keyword NLIST has been added to use a neighbor list for bias evaluation, this should be faster than grids with many CVs
  - in \ref METAD there are more checks that a restart of WALKERS_MPI is working consistently among walkers
  - in \ref driver there is a flag `--restart` that can be used to enforce restart (similar to using \ref RESTART in the PLUMED input file).
  - Added configure option `--enable-cxx`. Can be used to select C++14 with `--enable-cxx=14`. Required to compile against libraries
    whose header files need C++14.

- Changes in the OPES module
  - new action \ref OPES_EXPANDED
  - various new actions of type \ref EXPANSION_CV to be used with \ref OPES_EXPANDED
  - new action \ref OPES_METAD_EXPLORE

- For developers:
  - The C++ interface now performs type checking (see https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/pull/653).
    This should require no change for MD codes that were calling PLUMED with correct arguments.
    Checks could be disabled at runtime with `export PLUMED_TYPESAFE_IGNORE=yes`.
  - `xxd` replaced by a awk script. This removed the build dependence on vim.
  - Lepton has been updated with OpenMM 7.5.1.
